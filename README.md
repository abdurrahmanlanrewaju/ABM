## Introduction

In assignment explores the agent-based model (ABM) in order to  designing and build an agent-based model. Taking  through the complete design process, we explore the considerations required in 
defining a simulation _overview_, in designing the simulation _world_, the nature of agent _interactions_ with each other and the world around them, and how the _agents_ communication with environments. 


##Core components
Model code, which deals with interacting with the user and sets up the model, including running the model iterations and checking the stopping conditions. 
Agent code, which is used to build agents that can include the agent's behaviour and any records of their state. The behaviours implemented here is mathematical, or statistical. 



move(): The function moves agents in x and y axis randomly

eat(): The function defines how agents consume given resources

distance_between(): The function calculates distance between x and y axis

share_with_neighbours(): The function defines interaction of agents in neighborhood 






##Model

write_line_to_output(s): The function writes output and reads input from text file


get_maximum(): The function checks environment for largest value




get_minimum(): The function checks environment for minimum value


run(), update() and gentfunction() are developed  for GUI of the system
